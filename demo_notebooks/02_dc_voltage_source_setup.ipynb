    "These pertain to the trigger signal which we send from the RFSoC to the DAC.  The `trig_pin` is a digital output pin on the RFSoC which you must connect to your DC source. The pins are listed in the bottom of your QickConfig printout under \"6 digital output pins:\", and the physical location of these pins depends on if you are using the RF board/QICKBox firmware or not, with the standard QICK firmware having these triggers mapped to the PMOD0 header (marked 22 [here](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1390-zcu216-eval-bd/Board-Component-Location?section=kyi1567617969281__fig_xmm_ttm_1jb)).  If you are not using the QICKBox and RF board firmware, we recommend using a [level shifter](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-lvlshft-logic-level-shifter/?srsltid=AfmBOoqZodUKJkK6xvxAk7vgOS6NISjlLeNHoWDSeB-TueM1wp54cUVR) to buffer this trigger output."
