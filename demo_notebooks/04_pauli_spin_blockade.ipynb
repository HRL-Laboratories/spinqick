    "### SPAM Config\n",
    "First, lets revisit the experiment config file that we set up in `00_getting_started.ipynb`. As we set up SPAM for our device, we are going to be editing the `DefaultSpam` model for our qubit.  The parameters in this model are used by the functions in `spinqick.core.readout_v2.py`. If you want to write your own code to run on qick, you can import the `readout_v2` module in `core` and use these premade functions. If you use a different type of readout or spin-to-charge conversion, add it to spinQICK, we would love to help!"

    "Spin-to-charge routines in spinqick are broken into SPAM 'steps', and each step may either be a single coordinate in voltage space, or a ramp between two points. These are defined by the `SpamRamp` and `SpamPulse` models. For each spam step, the user can define a set of gates and voltages to play on each gate, as well as a duration (in microseconds). The `DefaultSpam` model is broken into six steps, shown above in Fig 1. a, - `flush`, `entry_20`, `meas`, `exit_11`, `idle`, and `entry_11`. SpinQICK will play the sequence `flush` -> `entry_20` ->  `exit_11` -> `idle` before coherent manipulations on the qubit (at the idle point E), and `entry_11` -> `meas` after. This is if the `reference` argument in `ReadoutParams` is `True`, spinQICK will also execute a reference measurement (`flush` -> `entry_20` ->  `meas`) first.\n",
