    "\n",
    "First we can connect to our qick board.  We use a pyro server to communicate with our board, which allows us to run python code on our computer instead of on the small cpu provided on the board. The package necessary to do this, Pyro4 (and only Pyro4), does not come natively installed with QICK. To learn more about using Pyro4 with QICK, you can find documentation [here](https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/blob/main/pyro4/00_nameserver.ipynb). \n",

Check to make sure the versions are compatible (as of this release, Pyro4 4.83 and seprent 1.41). The files can be moved to a local directory using PuTTY/PSCP (a demonstration of how to do this can be found in the QICK quick start guide [here](https://qick-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/quick_start.html#copy-the-qick-tools-onto-your-rfsoc)). \n",

    "Once installed, follow the steps found in the [`qick/pyro4`](https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/tree/main/pyro4) directory to instantiate the nameserver and local instrument server. You will need to make sure that your `proxy_name`, ip_address and port match those found when instantiating the local instrument server ([`qick/pyro4/01_server.ipynb`](https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/blob/main/pyro4/01_server.ipynb)).

    "\n",
    "Dot experiments can be complex and require keeping track and storing a large number of parameters.  Most of the parameters used in spinQICK are passed into the experiment code using a dictionary which we call a _config_. Some parameters in the config are shared across many experiments, for example the setup of readout parameters, like AC source-drain amplitude. We store these parameters in dictionaries which are saved to files (currently in json format), with filepaths specified in `spinqick.settings.filesettings` as shown above. The dictionaries are wrapped as [PyDantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models, which provide schema and data validation to ensure entries are of the correct type, within required value ranges, and item keys are correct. PyDantic also automatically turns keys into object members of the parent model, allowing for dot/autocompletion and linting, reducing the need to interact with the underlying config file or remember key values. PyDantic also natively emits JSON schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the hardware and experiment config templates located in `spinqick.models` to create some example configs. We start with the hardware config, which is a hardware map describing all of the low-speed and high-speed lines connecting to each gate. In our example we will define the output generator associated with one of our source-drain inputs of our dot-charge sensor (DCS), and the complementary ADC, with the address associated with the QICK signal generator and ADC channels found in the soccfg above. Using PyDantic models, we can then pass these configs into the primary `hardware_config_models.HardwareConfig`, which represents our simplified hardware setup. We can then save that config into a JSON file. \n",

    "Most experiments in the `spinqick.experiments` output an object from the `spinqick.core.spinqick_data` module.  This object contains data generated by the experiment, and a metadata about the experiment as well. It also contains a convenient method for saving data and metadata. We will explore this further in a future notebook, but for now here is an example of how to grab the data that was plotted above."
