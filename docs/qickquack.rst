The Harvey-Mudd College Quantum Analog Control Kit (QuACK) is an add-on that provides up to 32 channels of low-noise 20-bit `AD5791 <https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad5791.html>`__
DACS that can be directly controlled and triggered via QICK with no need for external triggers/markers. This low-cost alternative to commercial high-channel count low-noise DACs are
based off of the available `CN0531 <https://www.analog.com/en/resources/reference-designs/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0531.html>`__ eval board. QuACK is in late development, and will be
integrated into spinQICK in upcoming updates. More information can be found `here <https://github.com/hrl-labs-clinic-24-25>`__. Check in for updates!
